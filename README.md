This is a Django application we use for tracking our e-liquid manufacturing.  
It tracks recipes, flavours, how much stock of each flavour is remaining, what 
needs to be re-ordered, and so on.

It's not intended for general consumption, but you might find it useful.  It 
comes with no guarantee of support at all, but feel free to mail 
suggestions/comments/questions to <ft@le-fay.org>.
